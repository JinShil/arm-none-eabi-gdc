# arm-none-eabi-gdc
Bash script for creating an arm-none-eabi D cross-compiler on a Linux host.  It builds builds from [GDC master](https://github.com/D-Programming-GDC/GDC/tree/master).

It will require a GDC host boostrap compiler.  That can be built from [GDC stable](https://github.com/D-Programming-GDC/GDC/tree/stable).  Obtain [the build script](https://github.com/JinShil/native-gdc).
